          <h2>About Me</h2>     
          <p>
            I'm a recent graduate with a Master of Science degree in Mechatronics and Robotics from New York University. 
            I'm currently working as an Research Intern at the AI4CE Lab, under Dr. Chen Feng, where my research focuses on robotic perception and 3D mapping.
          </p>
          <p>
            My work involves developing and implementing advanced algorithms for object detection and tracking, utilizing technologies like ROS, 3D Gaussian Splatting, and Colmap. 
            A significant part of my current research is the <strong>MappingNYC</strong> project, which aims to create a comprehensive, multi-modal dataset of New York City's street views to enhance autonomous vehicle navigation in complex urban environments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking ahead, I aspire to pursue a Ph.D. in robotics and eventually work as a research scientist in the field of robotic perception. 
            My long-term vision is to establish an organization that fosters collaboration among talented individuals to advance sustainable technological developments and ignite new discoveries.
          </p>
          <p>
            What motivates me is the potential to create machines that can think and interact intelligently. 
            The idea of bringing a robot to life, with its limitless capabilities and indestructible existence, fuels my passion for robotics.

          <h2>Passion for Mentorship</h2>
          <p>
            In addition to my professional pursuits, I have a deep passion for teaching and sharing knowledge. 
            This interest sparked during my sophomore year when I began mentoring new teammates, and it has been a rewarding journey ever since. 
            I've volunteered as a mentor for the Robotics team at Poly Prep High School, guiding students in robotics as part of NYU's initiative to advance STEM education among underrepresented groups. 
            Under my mentorship, two teams achieved success in a national robotics competition, fostering their engineering skills and enthusiasm for the field. 
            This experience not only allows me to contribute to the community but also reinforces my commitment to inspiring the next generation of innovators.

          <h2>Hobbies</h2>
          <p>
            When I'm not immersed in robotics, I enjoy cooking, playing football, and gaming. These activities help me maintain a balanced perspective 
            and often inspire fresh ideas for my work. I'm always eager to connect with fellow enthusiasts and innovators in robotics, so if you're 
            interested in discussing projects or collaboration opportunities, please feel free to reach out!
